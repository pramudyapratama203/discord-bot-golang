Built with Golang for high efficiency and low latency, this Discord bot leverages the Google Gemini API to deliver intelligent, context-aware moderation that far exceeds traditional keyword filters. The system is engineered for the 2026 AI landscape, offering full support for an extensive fleet of models including the Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 series (Flash, Pro, and Lite), the Gemma 3 collection (ranging from 1b to 27b), and specialized tools like models/deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025 and models/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025. This integration ensures the bot remains at the forefront of AI safety, providing fast and accurate semantic analysis to keep digital community spaces inclusive and secure.
