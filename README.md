Built with Golang for high efficiency and low latency, this Discord bot leverages the Google Gemini API to deliver intelligent, context-aware moderation that far exceeds traditional keyword filters. The system is engineered for the 2026 AI landscape, offering full support for an extensive fleet of models including the Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 series (Flash, Pro, and Lite), the Gemma 3 collection (ranging from 1b to 27b), and specialized tools like models/deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025 and models/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025. This integration ensures the bot remains at the forefront of AI safety, providing fast and accurate semantic analysis to keep digital community spaces inclusive and secure.

Performance testing for this Golang-based Discord bot can be conducted by measuring the average latency between a user message and the AI response, specifically leveraging the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for its high-speed processing capabilities. The system's throughput can be evaluated by simulating concurrent message streams to ensure the backend handles multiple API calls without exceeding rate limits. Furthermore, the bot's effectiveness is measured through its detection accuracy across various linguistic nuances, supported by an extensive fleet of 2026 AI models including the Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 series (Flash, Pro, and Lite), the Gemma 3 family (1b, 4b, 12b, and 27b), and specialized engines such as models/deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025 and models/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025. This diverse model support allows for benchmarking across different architectures to achieve the perfect balance between speed and contextual understandin
