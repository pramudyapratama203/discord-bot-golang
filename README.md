This high-performance Discord moderation bot is built using Golang to provide a fast and efficient solution for maintaining healthy community environments. By integrating the Google Gemini API, specifically the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, it goes beyond traditional keyword filters to analyze the semantic context of messages in real-time. The system is future-proofed with support for an extensive fleet of 2026 models, including the Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 series (such as models/gemini-3-pro-preview and models/gemini-3-flash-preview), the Gemma 3 family (from 1b to 27b variants), and specialized tools like models/deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025 and models/gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025.
